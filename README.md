# BPE-Algorithm-Implementation
The primary goal of this assignment is to implement the Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) algorithm for tokenization and assess its performance using a NLTK dataset, with a focus on books. Additionally, you will create a reference tokenization using NLTK's punkt tokenizer for comparative analysis.
